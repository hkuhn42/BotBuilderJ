This project aims to define a java api for writing chatbots

- a basic Java api for Dialogs, Bots and API Connectors
- a set of utilities and base classes to speed up writing chatbots 
- an API Connector for a Java based implementation of the [Microsoft Bot Connector API - v3.0](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/connector/#navtitle) 

Work is under way to add support for
- more  connectors (XMPP, Email,...)
- a storage backend to keep track of chats and their participants
- api improvements
- a simple chat ui for websites (using wicket)

This is still a very young api. Expect lots of changes.
